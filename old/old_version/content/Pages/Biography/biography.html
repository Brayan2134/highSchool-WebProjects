                <p class="introduction">
                    As a student and ASP developer,
                    my path to what's happened now is a
                    bit odd to say the least.
                    In the beginning, I actually despised
                    the people who were doing what I do now,
                    how ironic haha!
                    My adventure started in the end of the 5th grade, when
                    we were choosing our electives for the 6th grade.
                    I was looking over the list and noticed that many of the available electives
                    were art: but the problem is that I didn't, and still don't, like art.
                    I decided to choose cooking as my elective, and computer science as an alternative.
                    6th grade came around, and as i'm looking at my schedule, I realized that I didn't 
                    recieve the cooking class, rather I got computer science.
                    I really wanted the cooking class, but didn't want to go talk to the counselors.

                CS Class Structure - 2014/15
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                Once I started my 'Computer Science' class, it was so basic that you CAN NOT 
                call it computer science!
                When we first arrived to the class, we had to get on Mavis Beacon - 
                a typing program.
                After that, the semester was divided into 3 main topics; Just typing, web development, and game development.
                Now please set those expectations very low, as we learned each one of these topics for only 6 weeks - 
                which isn't a lot of time for detailed learning.

                Deeper Learning - April-June 2015
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                The class was an hour long, 5 days a week but 
                when we started to learn about HTML, I 
                <b>REALLY</b>
                got into it! 
                I started to learn how to code better after school,
                and how to build the skills to make a nice looking webpage.
                I started to learn color schemes and how to make a nicer web page.
                I wanted to go the furthest possible and learn how to make the best website ever!
                Once the class ended, I never touched web design again.

                Freshman Year - 2017/18
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                My freshman year was when I really started to learn every aspect fo web design.
                I was in AVID when somone approached me about making them a website.
                They believed that because I had high grades and a big intrest in tech,
                I could make websites and apps.
                The offer that they gave me was irresistible, so I accpeted the offer, 
                and quickly got to work!
                I remembered most of the syntax, and thought this was going to be easy,
                but the client only requested for the website to be responsive, and that's where things
                got scary for me.
                I was scared of responsive design because I didn't understand it - until I learned about Bootstrap.
                With Bootstrap I started to make web pages really fast and responsive.
                That along with a few YouTube tutorials on design, and the intrest in me was sparked.
                I started to get more clients and didn't think that it could get any better than this.

            <p class="introduction">
                This past year has been full speed ahead
                on the web development path.
                This year i've learned these languages:
                C#, ASP.NET, Pascal.
                I've also learned these frameworks:
                Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and PHP (sort of a framework).
                I'm taking CS 1/2 (Pascal/Java), to learn more about coding,
                and WD 1/2 (HTML/PHP), to give me a space to help others learn to code,
                and give myself a space to learn what 
                <b>I WANT TO.</b>

                The Future
            </h4>
            <p class="introduction">
                What I plan on doing in the future is going to a full stack web development camp.
                While my web development will be on the side, what I really want to focus on 
                is software development - Freelance or at a company.
                I plan on learing React for web apps, along with more backend code 
                like mySQL, Ruby Etc.
                After I learn that I want to learn more cyber-security,
                and how to make secure credit card transactions and more!
                Once all of that learning is done,
                then I want to learn how to make PWA and applications
                that can scale!

                I was forced into CS in middle school.
                I liked it, and learned the entire syntax.
                Stopped learning it.
                Last year I picked it up again,
                and did client work.
                This year i'm learning web development along with 
                software development.
