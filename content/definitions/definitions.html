                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    This sounds like a very easy term
                    to figure out because
                    this term makes sense.
                    A static website is a
                    website that never changes.
                    Like this website that you're
                    looking at right now is a static website.
                    If I don't touch this website then nothing
                    will ever change.
                    On the other hand, dyamic pages
                    can run by themselves.
                    You can publish an article and
                    the developers have made
                    code so that it shows up on the home page.

                    CMS/CDN:    
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    If you ever want to have
                    a dynamic website then your going
                    to use these two words on a daily basis.
                    First lets start with a CDN,
                    or Content Delivery Network.
                    This is the equivilant of using your
                    Math Notebook while doing homework.
                    In simple terms, a
                    CDN is a way for web developers
                    to make websites faster, while usually
                    compromising control over the website
                    and speed at which the website is built.
                    A CMS is a CDN but on steriods.
                    A CMS, Content Management System,
                    is a way of web developers to have a 
                    website that they have full control ever. 
                    They can store data, like Amazon orders, 
                    while also having the power to
                    change anything they want.
                    A CMS is critical for scalability, 
                    a website that can serve everyone, 
                    as if you don't have control over a 
                    big website and something bad happens, 
                    like you got hacked,
                    then you can't really fix anything :(    
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-left mb-2 mt-2 text-danger">
                    ASP.NET:
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Hey look this is what I do! 
                    If you want a website to have a CMS 
                    and have the flexibility of a CDN 
                    then you can use ASP.NET. ASP stands for 
                    Active Server Pages, basically a dynamic page. 
                    The only difference is that you 
                    can individually choose what each 
                    page containes, 
                    and if you want then completely customize it. 
                    With a Dynamic CMS website,
                    you wouldn't be able to that.
                </p>

                    Responsive Design:
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Responsive design is the artform 
                    of creating webpages that work on a 
                    vast amount of devices, 
                    and customizing the expierence of each one. 
                    For example, let's say I have a page that 
                    sells food. If my customers saw really 
                    big text and none of it fit 
                    on the screen they may not want 
                    to order because they don't know 
                    if they should be on that spcific page, 
                    or if it's safe to order because they might get 
                    hacked or something.
                </p>

                    HTML v HTML5/4:
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    These are other words 
                    that you might need to start using 
                    if you want to become a web developer. 
                    HTML is just the umbrella of web development, 
                    also known as Hyper Text Markup Language. 
                    When you refer to just HTML 
                    you refer to the act of building a website, 
                    not how to build a website. 
                    Well thats were HTML5 comes in. 
                    The modern web uses HTML 5 and 4. 
                    Why use an older version of something 
                    on a big website? Well, HTML 5 is 
                    very new and has new features like inline 
                    video and sound! 
                    HTML4 is still used because 
                    it doesn't really lack anything MAJOR 
                    from HTML5 and since it's older, 
                    it has more help guides
                    and recources for you to learn.
